# LightGame_withUnity
Hello, This project is simple PC game.

It's a game where you can get to the destination with things to avoid falling obstacles.

The map background and story are organized differently depending on the obstacle you select before the game starts.

Language will mainly use C#, and I want to make it through unity.

# Code Style

I have said that I mainly use C# for language. I'll gradually write the issue of code style. 
It is expected that the code will not be large. and since it is my first project, it is still immature. so I will inform you of the code style while creating the code.
